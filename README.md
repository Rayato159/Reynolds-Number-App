<h1>Reynolds-Number-App</h1>

<p>I have studied aeronautical engineering but I'd love to code too much. This is a little project about mixing and matching with vanilla Javascript web-app for practice.</p>

<h3>What is Reynolds Number?</h3>
<p>In aeronautical engineering, we are well known for Reynolds Numbers. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless number. 
High values of the parameter indicate that viscous forces are small and the flow is essentially inviscid. reference <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/BGH/reynolds.html">click!</a></p>

<h2 id="html-create">How to build HTML for a web page</h2>
  <p>First, You don't need to worry about how it's beautiful or not. You just need to write all elements first. (I recommend drawing a sample flowchart before writing.)
  For example, I want to do a Reynolds Numbers calculator, So I need to write an input form for 4 variables (Density, Velocity, Length and, Dynamic Viscosity) at first.
  Next, do the button to submit the form. Last, do an element for the output result.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Time to code!!!</strong></h3>
    <p>Build a form to receive 4 variables (Density, Velocity, Length and, Dynamic Viscosity)</p>
  
    ```Javascript
      console.log('Test')
    ```
